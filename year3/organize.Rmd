# Workflow

- Workflow is a system to make it easier on your brain to do your work
- Don't waste time finding things or trying to remember that great idea you had
- We'll work toward an organized and systematic workflow that ensures replicability and minimizes mistakes
- **Keystone habit**: a way to organize all other good habits

# Getting organized

In the etiquette section, we talked about some very general tips for staying organized. This will be specific to research. Here, we'll cover strategies to organize...
1. notes for your research project
2. your project folders
3. notes on papers you've read
4. papers you're citing

---
# Project notebooks

- Organize your projects into notebooks (or folders) of some kind
- Two popular electronic options: OneNote, Evernote, Notion, just text files in a folder
- Other options: Bullet journals (pen and paper, gasp!)

# Project notebooks

Here's my system:
- Three main research notebooks: 1) ongoing research; 2) pending research; and 3) completed research
- **Pending research** is for ideas
    - Notes section for quick ideas
    - After some thought, transition to individual sections
    - After more thought, transition to **ongoing research** (if viable)

- **Ongoing research** is for actual working projects
    - Section for each project
    - Subsections for "meeting notes", "drafts", and "ideas/thoughts"

# Project notebooks

Here's my system:
- Three main research notebooks: 1) ongoing research; 2) pending research; and 3) completed research
- **Pending research** is for ideas
- **Ongoing research** is for actual working projects
- **Completed research** is for, you guessed it, completed projects
    - After paper is officially accepted and all supporting documentation finalized

# Project folders

Key is to have a system where files are named appropriately and everything is easily accessible. Basically it's a closet for your research.

# Project folders

- Project need not start out perfectly organized
- Think of the folder/file structure as your kitchen
    - It will get dirty
    - Don't let it get so dirty that you forget stuff
    - Clean up regularly!

---
# Reading papers

- We read lots of papers. That's part of the job and critical to doing good work. 
- Want to avoid losing our notes on paper's we've already read
- Lots of ways to store PDFs and handwritten notes
    - OneNote "learning" notebook (my preference)
    - Several Mac/iPad options
    - ReMarkable tablets with Dropbox sync (I think)
    

---
# Citation managers

- Lots of software options: Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote Web
- My system: manage on my own
  - Keep "BibTeX_Library.bib" folder updated on desktop
  - Sync with Google Drive
  - Pull down from Google Drive with Overleaf
  - Symbolic (soft) links in individual project folders
