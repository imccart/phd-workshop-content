# Keeping track

These slides are all about transparency and reproducibility (for your future self and for others). Some other resources...

- [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/)
- [Julian Reif's Guide for Replication with Stata](https://reifjulian.github.io/guide/)


---
# Automation

One benefit of good tracking and workflow is that you partially automate your projects...

- No repeating commands in the command line
- No copying and pasting values into tables
- No copying and pasting values into the text (harder to do)


---
# Naming files

Avoid spaces in file names. Avoid them at all costs. *DO NOT PUT SPACES IN YOUR FILE NAMES.*

>*"A space in a file name is a space in your soul."*

# Naming files

Avoid things like this...

.pre[
```

|---analysis
|   |   final_analysis.R
|   |   final_final_analysis.R
|   |   last_analysis.R

# Naming files

- Use dates in your filenames if necessary (YYYYMMDD format)
- Minimize the use of filename dates and instead try official version control
- Dates useful in log files and similar output (not under version control)


--
Related point...use common sense (but short) variable names without spaces

# Data workflow

Some quick thoughts on workflow

1. Avoid absolute path names!

# Data workflow

Some quick thoughts on workflow

1. Avoid absolute path names!

2. If you use the same data across projects, try a "path" script that you add to your `.gitignore` file, or use symbolic links `ln -s ~/base_location ~/new_location_with_link`

4. **NEVER** delete raw data files

# Version control

Critical for:

1. Internal validity (replicability for your future self)
2. External validity (replicability for others)


--
**note**: particularly important on the modern job market

---
count: false

# Version control

How do you track your versions?

- Don't keep two versions of the same thing
- Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. offer some form of version history (but incomplete)
- Overleaf has built-in version history
- Commit fully to Git/GitHub


--
Git is ideal since it is easily shareable, so you get external validity too

---
# Virtual environments

- Let's assume your code works on your system
- You (should) also want it to work on other computers
- How do you get other computers to look like your own?


--
 **Virtual Environments!**

---
count: false

# Virtual environments

Lots of ways to do this in practice:

1. Use `Docker` to basically mimic your entire machine

2. Use `renv` to make sure you note versions of all packages (in a .lock file)

3. `renv` also works with virtual Python environments `renv::use_python()`

---
# My basic workflow

  1. Create "empty" GitHub repo online

  2. Clone to my system in `RStudio` as a new project with version control, start `Stata` project in same directory

  3. Initialize my `R` environment with `renv` (more details [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)), change ado paths in `Stata` to call specific packages folder  
```
adopath + "stata_packages"
net set ado "stata_packages"
```  
  4. Create project "scaffolding" with initial directories
  
  
--
**note:** be sure to add "stata_packages" to gitignore file, and consider [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to create project from template

# My analysis and writing workflow

- I write everything in `R Markdown`
- With co-authors, I use Overleaf imported from GitHub
  - Use "Sync with GitHub" option (gives Overleaf read/write privileges)
  - Edit .Rmd files directly (easier to edit than TeX)
  - Push changes after edits
- Tables and figures in output folders (automate results)
- Compile with `R` (Pandoc)

---
# Alternative analysis and writing workflow

- Write in LaTeX
- Use Overleaf imported from Github
- Compile with Overleaf using output folder (tables and figures)
- Sync bibliography via Google Drive 
    - Upload from URL, `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=name`, where name is the alphanumeric string from Google Drive link
