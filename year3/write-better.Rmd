# How to write?

I wish I knew!

But there are some basic rules that might help

# Introduction

The introduction is critical. It is the most important thing you'll write for any paper. Make it awesome!

# Introduction

A simple [formula](https://www.albany.edu/spatial/training/5-The%20Introduction%20Formula.pdf)

1. **The Hook!** Why should anyone care about this at all? What big issue are you dealing with?

2. **Question.** What are you actually going to do? What is your actual research question?

3. **Context.** What are the key things that other people have done? What literature should a reader know in order to understand your contribution?

4. **Contribution.** What are you doing differently? Your contribution is in the context of the existing literature, but the question (number 2) should stand-alone. You don't need the literature to pose the question in an interesting way.

5. **Expand.** I've added this. Modern applied papers (for better or worse) need to talk about some key additional findings in the intro (mechanisms, robustness, and policy implications, etc.).
