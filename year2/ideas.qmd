# Where to get ideas?

1. Read non-academic policy papers/briefs
   - Commonwealth Fund
   - Petersen-KFF
   - Health Affairs or NEJM Opinion Pieces

   - Get TOC notifications from relevant journals
   - NBER working papers
   - Listen with audemic.io


---

3. Seminars
   - Attend and read papers in advance
   - Meet with speakers and ask questions

---


4. Talk to faculty
   - Be engaged in classes...think about potential research ideas
   - Schedule meetings and come with some questions

---


5. Talk to classmates
   - Ask questions and throw out some ideas
   - Learn from each other


---

6. Diversify
   - Read and take classes outside of your narrow subfield
   - You are an **economist** first
   - Be curious and engaged



# Keep track of your ideas

**Three general categories:**

1. Brainstorming (no idea is too crazy)
   - Talk about these with peers
   - Look into the literature and potential data
   - Craft an actual question
2. Research proposals (more developed)
   - Slightly more formalized and developed
   - Talk about these with classmates and faculty
3. Research plan (ready to go)
   - Vetted by peers and faculty
   - Ready to start the actual research process
