# Academic Website

You've got to make your materials easily accessible, and a website is the easiest way to do that. This is a necessity for job market candidates at this point.

- Keep documents accessible
    - GitHub
    - Built-in server space (SquareSpace, etc.)

# Getting started

Lots of options to get a decent website up and running

- Google Sites
- SquareSpace
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with selected theme...


---
# What is Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go.

- Takes your content (text, md, Rmd, etc.) and template info as input
- Creates final static website


---
# Using Hugo

- Can use from the command line
- Generate "public" directory that you can publish directly
- Or, host on GitHub and deploy on Netlify


---
# Using GitHub/Netlify

- It's free!
- Netlify deploys site, don't version the "/public/" directory
- Allows semi-customized domain names
- Note: may need to change environment variable, `HUGO_VERSION = 0.74.3`


---
# Themes

Lots of good Hugo themes available

- I use the "coder" theme on [my site](https://ianmccarthyecon.netlify.app/)
- "Academic" theme is extremely popular. That's on [David's site](https://www.davidjachochavez.org/).


---
# Managing content

- No web developer, html, or css expertise required
- Can use with Jupyter Notebooks and Rmarkdown


---
# Caveat

- Getting started with Hugo can be cumbersome
- Lots of "built in" features that you'll want to drop
- "Academic" theme has changed to "Wowchemy", which sounds fake almost
