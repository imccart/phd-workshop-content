# Quick summaries

- Writing a paper is great. 
- Presenting papers in conferences can be really fun. 
- But this is all "academic facing" work for your field/subfield.
- How can you get other people to read it?

# Quick summaries

So how do we do this?

- **Not** op-eds. I mean an accurate summary of your work but easy and quick to consume.
- Visual abstracts
- Short videos
- Twitter threads

---
# Visual abstracts

- Really just a slide to summarize your work
- Concise but fair to your main point

---
# Short videos

- Everybody's doing it!
- Our own Santi's [JMP](https://www.smontoyablandon.com/#jmp)


---
# Twitter threads

- Everbody's doing it!
- Too many examples to list...[bestofecontwitter](https://bestofecontwitter.substack.com/)


---
# Twitter

Most people share all of this, including links to papers, on Twitter...

- Join #econtwitter
- Relatively inclusive community with lots of shared papers and info
- I've learned a lot and seen many papers that I wouldn't have otherwise seen
- Follow Academic Sequitur, @AcademicSeq
- Follow NBER and journals (in and out of your field)

# Twitter etiquette

While we're on it, let's talk Twitter etiquette...

1. **Tone**: Be kind. 


--
This is not the setting for criticism. Jokes also don't tend to land well through tweets.

# Twitter etiquette

While we're on it, let's talk Twitter etiquette...

1. **Tone**: Be kind. 
2. **Blocking**: #econtwitter is generally very kind and inclusive. But #twitter is not. Feel free to block people that are rude.


--
Unfollowing and muting are also options, but blocking is generally recommended.

3. **Replies**: Two ways to respond...reply or retweet.


--
Respond if you want to have a conversation. Retweet with comment if it's standalone. Poor taste to retweet with comment if you're discussing the content of the original tweet.

For example, positive comments about some work, or a retweet where you add an author.

# Timing

A natural question regarding how to promote your paper on social media...when should I do it?

- Not until you're confident of the results!
- Need not wait for official publication
- R&R is OK, depending on the reviewer comments

--
- Talk to your adviser (and co-authors) before promoting your papers
